/**
 * @brief The JOIN command indicates that the client wants to join the given channel(s), 
 * 	each channel using the given key for it. The server receiving the command checks 
 * 	whether or not the client can join the given channel, and processes the request. 
 * 
 * 	While a client is joined to a channel, they receive all relevant information about 
 * 	that channel including the JOIN, PART, KICK, and MODE messages affecting the channel. 
 * 	They receive all PRIVMSG and NOTICE messages sent to the channel, and they also 
 * 	receive QUIT messages from other clients joined to the same channel (to let them 
 * 	know those users have left the channel and the network). 
 * 
 *  Numeric Replies:
 *  
 *  ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS (461)
 *  ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL (403)
 *  ERR_TOOMANYCHANNELS (405)
 *  ERR_BADCHANNELKEY (475)
 *  ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN (474)
 *  ERR_CHANNELISFULL (471)
 *  ERR_INVITEONLYCHAN (473)

 *  Examples:
 * 	[CLIENT]  JOIN #foobar
 *  [SERVER] ; join channel #foobar.
 * 
 * 	[CLIENT]  JOIN #foo,#bar fubar,foobar
 * 	[SERVER]; join channel #foo using key "fubar" and channel #bar using key "foobar".
